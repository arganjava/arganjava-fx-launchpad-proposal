**Ecosystem Fit/Impact**

Details: \
Many blockchain network will popular because of ecosystem and solve problem case, blockchain without usecase is nothing, that's why we build lauchpad to make big impact for the network and make profit for those network by taking transaction fee and many user to buy fx token. 

Having launchpad on FX Network stakeholders (i.e. users, developers, investors) to easily stay up to date on Function X Network ecosystem updates, see the latest news and developments, do research and stay engaged. In general users who can track their favourite projects more easily stay more engaged with the project which in turn supports user retention. 

We’ve done market research on this and currently people’s regular crypto workflows consist of jumping from one browser tab to another to check prices, read news, follow twitter, participate in discussions . A typical crypto user will have 6 to 10 open tabs at any given time and people have referred to Alphaday as the ‘tab killer’ because all the information you’d need across all your different tabs is available in Alphaday. In this sense, we do not have any direct competitor that can provide 50 different types of services and functionality within one dashboard.

Are there any other projects similar to yours in other EVM/Cosmos ecosystem? \
