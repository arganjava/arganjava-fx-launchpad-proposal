**Ecosystem Fit/Impact**

Details: \
Many blockchain network will popular because of ecosystem and solve problem case, blockchain without usecase is nothing, that's why we build launchpad to make big impact for the network and make profit for those network by taking transaction fee and many users or traders to buy fx token. 

Having launchpad on FX Network stakeholders (i.e. users, developers, investors) to easily get latest for startup project, see the latest news and developments, do research and stay engaged. In general users can join or invest for new IDO/ICO projects safely and easier as holders fund is protected by our system.

Are there any other projects similar to yours in other EVM/Cosmos ecosystem? No, but we will create new platform more secure, easier and much benefit and features\

Development status: Still Idea\

Associated costs

15,000 USDT upfront costs for development including for launchpad MVP, blog medium post, content social feed,TVL(Total value locked) and crypto data metrics.

6000 USDT per month for 12 months for maintenance including having an launchpad content analyst quality-checking the dashboard every day and ensuring the Calendar widget is up-to-date with latest Function X Network events, all news mentions across the internet are captured by the dashboard, any updates automatically captured by the launchpad platform engine and add to dashboard, and other maintenance tasks.
