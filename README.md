**Ecosystem Fit/Impact**

Details: \
Many blockchain network will popular because of ecosystem and solve problem case, blockchain without usecase is nothing, that's why we build launchpad to make big impact for the network and make profit for those network by taking transaction fee and many users or traders to buy fx token/coin. 

Having launchpad on FX Network stakeholders (i.e. users, developers, investors) to easily get latest for startup project, see the latest news and developments, do research and stay engaged. In general users can join or invest for new IDO/ICO projects safely and easier as holders fund is protected by our system.

Are there any other projects similar to yours in other EVM/Cosmos ecosystem? No, but we will create new platform more secure, easier and much benefit and features\
